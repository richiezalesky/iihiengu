They're shared by NFS (/etc/exports, insecure & all_squash mapped to a proper user). - Permissions are correct (775 & proper users & groups all over) - a Kodi/Openelec installed on Solidrun CubeTV, and it works very well (I can see the folde. I searched for it by name and by need for speed and the app didn't appear anywhere and a Google search doesn't yield anything either. What gives? Did it not release. 
I bought NFS Shift and the Sims 3 when they were on sale for .99 in the market and I have to say I have a renewed faith in gaming on Android. Both games were well worth the price According to phandroid the Android version will be open world. This is not really based on anything so will have to wait and see. The main concern I have is that fire monkeys is well known for forgetting android.

It seems there is a lot of salt lately towards crucible and proficient PVP players. A vocal portion of the community seems to despise crucible at this point in time. To be honest a lot of it seems like scrub mentality where people can't accept their own shortcomings so they'd would rather blame other players or mechanics in the game. However, I'd like to challenge my perception and learn more about what turns people off to Destiny PVP. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I love playing PVP (comp. ##### War Robots Test Server Page (https://www.facebook.com/wwr.test.page/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARBRu4YQCfLXrt4i-nyuSvAl0K9xRSr5qcScI9Nuq1vCc5FiVOc9xJvzE3qbXNd68g0SCrAsDzrvMl1R&hc_ref=ARTKi-4ajqgBQkwY2xFQQXbXLrcc9V-fEr2-Ry3U33IOk6clMSKUcD-7bRsaKL1NZ3o&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCpCVTTR5Ba6DQ4Z6KEGrHlamXZRmSxA4uNnYBxzKb3SeG_zpaTVU_ljbkUzdyN5tFcylef6BcOZLyJqis_zSfoszt7q58E2EE--R_U0jMgqqI0myAFuXGpf5I-6Q7chvvqKNPJEK8g8ykGyk5sRYEGenCS9jrEcN6NgjwiKuunqAUtcTrOK6Kk3ki922cRAQQECbv4Ejinuej. #Respect Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099 (https://i.imgur.com/s9Lch6N.png)!

I'm 37 years old and have a problem. I oftentimes find myself indecisive over what to play because I've come to notice that many of the genres that I enjoyed a lot in my younger years have become very difficult. I believe it's because many game-makers have increased their games' realism to the point that it just becomes a task to play, rather than being able to enjoy the game, or have added paywalls to their games making it impossible to enjoy. For instance, I love city sim games Hello! I want to preface by saying I never truly understood what Emby or Plex do, or why they'd benefit me. I always avoided them because I thought "I don't need transcoding, all the Kodi devices in my house are NVidia Shields that are more than capable, and I don't need to stream outside my home". So right now I have a 48TB Synology DiskStation serving content over NFS. 3 Shield TVs in my home connect to this NFS repository, and every time they're turned on, they scan. This gets painful. ###### War Robots Test Server Page (https://www.facebook.com/wwr.test.page/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARDGkVxudMPdsNGk5N7uIs22PMPoKLlE8FW3b5-1xLOjW53caT0n0qQRjMq9HIFPdHf0nfB0AcGke0Z5&hc_ref=ARQ7zqXyiRixnNVA16FzggPkO1sTuNqbb_0dH8_tNCxu0nMKEFBuTqSLyw6N3x5ALyc&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDLvTyhsil94S3zP0yShcpnH1kMpn96usihhsx7N_zDPmus-9JDCelTxAxZV3wlJoiaHTYa_OYKak_Nv4qleE4BvfjIuf1mKC_pa1m34A8taXCpowepB3EpTK5f9i6BiJ4BwJSJUuQ2xv0ywH81woebIt6VS-N5W0JI_OKzaPgqYZQrwT8YefmU-H1Bwkl9yV2cuC-fJlU0MY.

Hey, I've been playing simulators for about 15 years and now I want to take a bit of a break and enjoy some casual racing, but I'm really not up to date on this category. The only arcade games I've ever played are NFS:U2 and Real Racing 3 on Android (if that even counts). I have GRID Autosport on Steam, so I gave it a try, but I found the controls horrible with a wheel. Not sure if it's my fault for even trying instead of using a controller and digital inputs or if it's unique to GRID Autosport. ## War Robots Test Server Page (https://www.facebook.com/wwr.test.page/?__tn__=kC-R&eid=ARDmAid9gFExx7rVYkq1xF3mRs--zMXfvfWIkONFC1Nq3jqncThF4llNLiZ2Xqi745AxJsqBxhbYbW80&hc_ref=ARS6pogZ3e2ppMr8R08SitJ_0N7Md4rmFOvVyvZ5NefM77PpNry16_C7-TOOpF7kpmQ&fref=nf&__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCXRoFAJb3FpBGMmom8vfY0ZGX5FixnYqMYIzjEhm4OmnA308E4YdL3wmIdejkCT4l_Nq1oCmoVe__bBBNBj2m4AvZrHj5FYrvjuEHbrzxxzB3p1Ta7hUdy16EE-b9jqAzN-i9uvnkshA6d3lpaZyacBEv5Ytzs4oSCtHfaN9J6DeAeifWTdTD7oZyv9ajQyly4YZIlo6oFKLDba9-WJ. Hi everyone, first time PC builder here. Just wanted to make sure all my parts are compatible and will fit in my case without issues. I am also open to suggestions on parts that I could change. The purpose of the computer will be for 1080p 144Hz gaming, possible streaming in the future, VR, programming such as developing Android apps, and running virtual machines. For gaming, I'm going for 144+ fps in eSports titles such as Rainbow 6, Overwatch, and CSGO and decent fps like maybe Has anyone found a way to fix the issue on Android clients (in my case a shield) where it randomly tells you "Your connection to the server is not fast enough to stream this video"? Its seems I'm not the only one (https://forums.plex.tv/t/plex-player-on-shield-your-connection-to-the-server-is-not-fast-enough-to-stream-this-video/225489/5). For 2018, I had a box sitting in my basement with a plex server pulling stuff off a NFS share to a FreeNAS server. Never had any problem.
