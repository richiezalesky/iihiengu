For reference I have 7 years consumer and 5 years enterprise IT experience. My main rig is an i9-9900k/2080 Ti behemoth. Work provided laptop is a 2016 MBP 15".

Windows 10 Pro - v.1809. Intel. I just purchased a Certified Refurbished Dell XPS 15 9570. From Day 1 it has been giving me BSOD with the message "DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE" This seems to be a wireless adapter issue my hints below Google Chrome (72.0.3626.121) DNS Resolution for a site will fail and 15-30 seconds later the BSOD appears. CMD Prompt ping/traceroute seems affected during that period I will turn on Mini Dumps, I haven't had time to configure Windows in the few days I have had it for better error. On 2/8 I purchased an XPS 9570, the next day I got a message that the CPU fan was not operating. I returned it, I looked into Precisions, and other machines and ultimately decided an XPS 9570 had all the features I wanted. I Purchased another one on the Outlet with the Premium Support and Accidental Damage Coverage, along with a TB16 and a U3419W. Between 2/23 and 3/5. Day one (within an hour) of opening the new 9570, it proceeded to BSOD "Driver Power State Failure" It proceeded I manage 200 laptops for a company. Over the past two weeks, we're getting hammered with a pernicious bug where our bluetooth cards stop working. This happens regardless of what kind of bluetooth card the laptop has, and regardless of which driver version. I've seen it happen on Dell XPS 13 9360s and 9370s, on both Killer Wireless and Intel WiFi cards. I believe it is a Windows bug where Windows is putting the bluetooth card to sleep and then never wakes it up again. Sympoms I manage 200 laptops for a company.

Sympoms I've used the Custom charging scheme on my XPS 13 (9370) and set it either using the Linux app or directly in the BIOS. Today I'm running Windows (installed from the MSFT download, not the factory installation so I decided to do it using the Dell Power Manager app. Google finds me a page at Dell.com (https://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/04/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/dell-power-manager) that tells me it is available in the store or directly. 
Excuse me while I vent my frustration with this machine and the entire experience of ownership. I keep getting the impression that there is some belief that the onus was on me to have resolved this personally straight out of the box and I strongly disagree. I’m not going to stand for having the blame shifted onto me and since I feel as though that is what has been trying to happen I am going to unload on what my experience has been. I worked in the IT field for several years as a technicia. Hi, I own a XPS 15 9570 with i7-8750h, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM DDR4. Everything was working well and as intended to until yesterday when I had the BSOD error of DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE. So I realized it may be time for me to update all my drivers so I did. I used windows update and dell support assist to install the drivers, and after the BIOS update my USB-C to Ethernet has not been working, The error the troubleshooter has said is " Ethernet doesn't have valid ip configuration?".

After sobbing a bit that I didn't get a Samsung drive (or ordered a 256GB and upgraded it manually) I set to work to fix its performance. I need this laptop for work pretty much immediately, so I have no time to exchange it. Looking at AS SSD Benchmark, I was ultimately able to squeeze out a lot more performance. The differences are much smaller when looking at CrystalDiskMark's results. I don't 
Hello, /r/techsupport! I’m running Windows 10 on a Dell XPS 8920. Lately I’ve been having problems with the computer starting up halfway, BSODing with a “CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED” or “DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE,” and then starting up normally. No issues after the computer is up and running. I had the motherboard replaced a couple months ago, but this problem started in the past week so I don’t know if the two events are related. In my quest to fix it myself, I ended up changing my power settings. Microsoft will terminate support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.

Update 12/12/16 - I've determined my Razer Blade Pro has a defective Raid0 Array, SSD Drives, or Intel Driver, and believe this to be an issue across their entire Razer Blade Pro line due to poor testing and QC. ampnbsp; Seeing as there haven't been any real reviews or in-depth information on Razer Blade Pro's in the wild, probably given the 00.00+ price tag, I figured I'd give an account of my experience so far. ampnbsp; My Review ampnbsp; Pro's Slim attractive. #Welcome windows Refugees, welcome to GNU/Linux Microsoft will terminate support for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025.

Microsoft terminated support for Windows I have recently had my laptop crash numerous times. This has happened while using VLC, playing games like FIFA 16, GTA V and Withcer 3. The errors that I have received: Video scheduler internal error (most common in games) Critical process died (most common in vlc) There are other erros as well, but I do not seem to recal them. I am including several crash dump files that I have collected with BlueScreenView, but they do not seem to include all the crashes. I have multiple times tried. I'm wondering if my graphics card is finally kill after owning this computer for almost five years. Geforce Experience and driver installers both refuse to recognize "compatible graphics hardware" even though I have a Geforce GT 420M inside my machine. Nor did it show up in BIOS. It DID show up in Device Manager as a hidden device, disconnected with Code 45, before I disabled it in an attempt to get it working again - now it's not even showing up there. What is showing up in Device Manager. Fault injection is a side channel attack. Does fault injection evidence power line communication (PLC) hacking? Or is the fault injection by some other means? Interpretations of the PE (1:) volume dump is appreciated. "Side channel analysis and fault injection are techniques to break various security mechanisms, allowing an attack to load arbitrary firmware code and discover secrets such as cryptographic keys and PINs from hardware and embedded software. They were first (publicly) discovered. </p>
