                            <p>Looking to get a list of the top songs for each year. I'll start. Some songs that will always be stuck in my head for having listening to them over and over. Gob - I hear you Calling (NHL 02) The Kills - Cheep and Cheerful (NHL 09) Treble Charger - Brand New Low (NHL 02) Sugarcult - Memory (05) The Black Keys - Howling for you (11) Dropkick Murphy's There were always a few really good tracks (and some bad ones) in every edition of EA NHL. Is there a spot on the internet I can at least look at a list of them so I can download Hey guys, I was sick of getting forced to love the colore blue thats why I made a NHL All-time playlist. But since I am only 19 and playing sice 04/08 I probably missed some good songs! Thats why I need your advice on which songs to add. BTW I found out that NHL´s soundtrack became shittier and shittier since NHL 15. If you are Intrested this is the link to the playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4YWlHQjxs2wvApQ3NmuJjG Edit: Pls do not judge me for my grammer or spelling, I am germa. Welcome to the 11th installment of our Governor's Ball Artist of the Week threads! In these threads I will give you all the basic information you could want on an artist playing the festival. Please share your thoughts on them in the comments and if anyone has seen them live, please talk about their performance. Thanks for checking this out, and feel free to spread the word about the threads! Next week will be: Vic Mensa. --- Artist: Manchester Orchestra (http://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/. It’s time once again for me to pick my favorite albums of the month! May was a month of extraordinary achievements in music, with a few disappointments on my part. Some of those disappointments are still good and will be on the list, others will not. Both PWR BTTM’s and Harry Styles’ new albums failed to impress outside of a few individual tracks (the self-titled track for the former, Sign of the Times for the latter), and a few others while being good albums in their own way, still didn’t.

I grew up a spoiled single kid. I had friends, toys amp games and a great house. I got addicted to hockey at age 5 and naturally I starting playing all the hockey video games. In late 2007, NHL 08 came out, I was 8 years old. My friends and I would play that game for hours everyday, it was really a good time for me in my childhood.

In response to the "what song reminds you of hockey" thread from yesterday, what's the fondest NHL soundtrack do you remember? Personally for me, I most fondly remember the NHL 08 soundtrack. Having the Black Keys and the Mooney Suzuki on that soundtrack actually introduced to me to garage rock, plus Datarock and Santigold were also fantastic.
